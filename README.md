## Overview

Secure-Pay is a next-generation reversible crypto payment platform built natively for the Somnia ecosystem, designed to revolutionize how users send and receive cryptocurrency using simple usernames instead of complex wallet addresses.

From a single, intuitive dashboard, users can send crypto payments using usernames with customizable expiration times, claim payments before they expire, automatically refund unclaimed payments, and track all transaction history with complete on-chain transparency. Every payment is secured by smart contract logic, ensuring funds are protected until claimed or automatically returned to the sender.

With Secure-Pay, crypto payments aren't just faster and cheaper—they're user-friendly, reversible, and built for the next generation of decentralized commerce where anyone can send crypto using simple usernames.

## The Problems in Web3 Payments Today

- **Complex wallet addresses** make sending crypto confusing and error-prone
- **No way to reverse payments** if sent to wrong address or unclaimed
- **Poor user experience** with long, complex wallet addresses

- **High gas fees** from complex payment systems
- **No automatic refunds** for unclaimed payments

## Secure-Pay's Solution

- **Username-Based Payments** – Send crypto using simple usernames instead of wallet addresses
- **Reversible Payments** – Payments automatically refund if not claimed within expiration time
- **Time-Bound Security** – Customizable expiration times (0.1-168 hours)
- **Smart Contract Security** – Funds secured until claimed or refunded
- **On-Chain Transparency** – All payments verifiable on SomniaScan
- **User-Friendly Interface** – Intuitive design for seamless experience
- **Cross-Border, Bank-Free** – Instant blockchain settlement worldwide

## Why Secure-Pay Stands Out from Other Web3 Payment Solutions

### Full Payment Lifecycle
We're not just payments—we handle the entire reversible payment lifecycle, including deposits, claims, refunds, and expiration management, all on-chain.

### Time-Bound Security
Using smart contract logic, payments automatically expire and refund if not claimed within the specified timeframe, preventing lost funds.

### Smart Contract Architecture
Every payment is secured by our deployed smart contract, ensuring funds are protected and transactions are transparent.

### Integrated User Portal
Other tools focus only on basic transfers—Secure-Pay gives users their own secure space to track payments, manage reversible transactions, and view transaction history.
